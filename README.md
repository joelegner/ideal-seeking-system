# Ideal-Seeking System

## Purpose

The purpose of the Ideal-Seeking System is to set [Goals] pointed to a set of [Ideals] according to stated [Values] by using [Resources] to execute [Processes] to establish and achieve [SMART Objectives].

## Ideals

Ideals are aspirations that are never going to be achieved.

1. All beings free from suffering.
1. All beings content.

The first one might be considered primary. The second one is to mitigate against the risk of the system developing into the equivalent of the Marvel supervillian Thanatos, but not stopping with one-half of beings.

## Goals

Goals are long-term without strict acceptance criteria.

See **Mind Map** for a list of goals.

## Objectives

Each objective has a due date less than 1 year away. Anything longer than that should be re-categorized as a goal or split into smaller objectives that will not take more than a year to achieve.

See **Mind Map** for a list of objectives.
